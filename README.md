# Miseq Binary Parser

This module is built to replace the [Illuminate](https://github.com/nthmost/illuminate) package, which has not seen an update in over 7 years.

The foundation of this code is based on the [MiCall](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall) project's [Error Metrics Parser](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall/blob/master/micall/monitor/error_metrics_parser.py), [Quality Metrics Parser](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall/blob/master/micall/monitor/quality_metrics_parser.py), and [Tile Metrics Parser](https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall/blob/master/micall/monitor/tile_metrics_parser.py).

For an indepth breakdown of binary formats used, see the [Illumina binary formats](https://illumina.github.io/interop/binary_formats.html) page.
